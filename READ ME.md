Graphs


A graph, like a tree, is a nonlinear data structure consisting of nodes and links between the nodes 
There are two types of graphs
Directed graphs - nodes/vertices that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional
Undirected graphs - nodes/vertices that are connected together, where all the edges are unidirectional


Graphs allow you to store information about the relationship between the different component(people, building, streets etc), literally anything
Graphs allow you to store these information in a way that makes it easier for you to come up/implement the different algorithms to solve problems.(ex: weather nodes are connected, shortest path between two vertices, etc)
They are visually appealing and easier to read opposed to other data structures
They also display second order connections, which most other data structures don't show


My project basically utilizes the graph class to create a connection between people who are roommates in an apartment, it's a variation from the social problem from the textbook. (pg 780 problem 7). In my project for someone to be roommate with another they must be connected by edges. With my project you are able to add roommates by connecting two vertices together and remove roommates by removing the edge between two vertices.
Other functions in my project include: moveIn, roommates, commonRoomates, isRoomate
I choose this project because, it makes good use of the graph data structure and it could be useful for a landlord who wants to keep track of everyone in their building.
